Presentation
================================
The target of epyk is to ensure the implementation of a coherent system using a minimum of layers.
With epyk the user stays in the Python layer to drive and optimize the data transformation.
This Framework also encourages the implementation of Micro services and cloud based architecture.

Compatibility
================================

Epik is compatible with the most common Web Python Frameworks (Flask and Django).
By default, the server package embeds a Flask app as it is easier to install and ready to use.

The Framework can be included within a :doc:`jupyter/Jupyter` or :doc:`jupyter/JupyterLab` project. But this will lead to some limitations - for example Ajax and Socket will not be available.

Get Started
=================================

In the following sections you will learn how to build complex HTML/JS reports using only python through the followings concepts:

.. toctree::
    :glob:
    :maxdepth: 5
    
    report
    themes
    components
    html_builtins
    css_builtins
    js_builtins
    

Those are the basics of the Epyk framework, then you can move to using complex objects relying on Javascript Libraries such as:

- `D3 <https://d3js.org/>`_
- `ChartJs <https://d3js.org/>`_
- `Tabulator <https://d3js.org/>`_
- `DataTables <https://d3js.org/>`_
- and more, for an exhaustive list of supported libraries and frameworks please see :doc:`supported_ext`


Coming Soon
================================

Please get in touch if there is any feature you feel Epyk-UI needs.
