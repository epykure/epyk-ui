UI Interface
============

The UI interface allows you to access the different parts of the framework without having to know the underlying details how these components
are built.

These interfaces are as follows:

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 1
    
    /report/ui/compositions
    /report/ui/geo
    /report/ui/graphs
    /report/ui/tables


.. currentmodule:: epyk.interfaces.Components

.. autoclass:: Components
